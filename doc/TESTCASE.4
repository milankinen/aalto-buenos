Assignment 1
--------------------
The correct functionality of the TLB can be verified by running old tests.
For instance
>sh startprog.sh run_all_tests
>sh startprog.sh shell
launches the shell implemented in previous assignments.

Note: all files and commands must start with / when using the shell
since the addition of SFS.


Assignment 3 - Malloc and Free
----------------------------------------------
Tests are in files:
    tests/test_malloc.c
    tests/test_memlimit.c.

To run the tests compile userland programs and then in the project folder
run command:

    ./prepdisk.sh && ./startprog.sh test_memlimit

or

    ./prepdisk.sh && ./startprog.sh test_malloc

Note: prepdisk.sh needs to be run only once since it only writes the
userland programs to [disk1] of our buenos instance.

Memlimit test tries to get current heap in multiple positions, allocate
small amount of heap, free small amount of heap, allocate over one page,
free over one page, allocate the whole memory, move heap lower than heap
end and finally to return the heap to its original position. If output
is OK then memlimit works as is expected.

Malloc tests try to allocate and free different amounts of memory but
unfortunately at current state any (proper) malloc call will just kill
the process because of TLB store exception. Failing line is documented
in the code as a FIXME comment (tests/malloc.c:105).
